# Spring 

* 官网：[https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework)

## Design Philosophy

* Provide choice at every level.

* Accommodate diverse perspectives.
* Maintain strong backward compatibility.
* Care about API design.
* Set high standards for code quality.

## IOC Container

This chapter covers the Spring Framework implementation of the Inversion of Control (IoC) principle. IoC is also known as dependency injection (DI). It is a process whereby objects define their dependencies (that is, the other objects they work with) only through constructor arguments, arguments to a factory method, or properties that are set on the object instance after it is constructed or returned from a factory method. The container then injects those dependencies when it creates the bean. This process is fundamentally the inverse (hence the name, Inversion of Control) of the bean itself controlling the instantiation or location of its dependencies by using direct construction of classes or a mechanism such as the Service Locator pattern.

### BeanFactory

* confiuration framework
* basic functionality

### ApplicationContext

* Easier integration with Spring's AOP Features
* Message resource handling
* Event publication
* Application-layer specific contexts such as the `WebApplicationContext` for use in web applications.

### Bean

In Spring, the objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by the Spring IoC container are called beans. A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and otherwise managed by a Spring IoC container. Otherwise, a bean is simply one of many objects in your application. Beans, and the dependencies among them, are reflected in the configuration metadata used by a container.

### Container Overview

  * annotations

## Configuration Metadata

As the preceding diagram shows, the Spring IoC container consumes a form of configuration metadata. This configuration metadata represents how you, as an application developer, tell the Spring container to instantiate, configure, and assemble the objects in your application.

However, you can use Spring’s integration with AspectJ to configure objects that have been created outside the control of an IoC container. See [Using AspectJ to dependency-inject domain objects with Spring](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/core.html#aop-atconfigurable).

* A package-qualified class name
* Bean behavioral configuration elements（scope , lifecycle callbackes）

* References to other beans that are needed for the bean to do its work
* Other configuration settings to set in the newly created object

### Dependency injection Source

In addition to bean definitions that contain information on how to create a specific bean, the `ApplicationContext` implementations also permit the registration of existing objects that are created outside the container (by users). This is done by accessing the ApplicationContext’s BeanFactory through the `getBeanFactory()` method, which returns the BeanFactory `DefaultListableBeanFactory` implementation. `DefaultListableBeanFactory` supports this registration through the `registerSingleton(..)` and `registerBeanDefinition(..)` methods. However, typical applications work solely with beans defined through regular bean definition metadata.
