# What is Spring ?

*[维基]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Framework)
)：*
> The **Spring Framework** is an [application framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_framework "Application framework") and [inversion of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control "Inversion of control") [container](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servlet_container "Servlet container") for the [Java platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_platform "Java platform"). The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the [Java EE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_EE "Java EE") (Enterprise Edition) platform. Although the framework does not impose any specific [programming model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_model "Programming model"), it has become popular in the Java community as an addition to the [Enterprise JavaBeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_JavaBeans "Enterprise JavaBeans") (EJB) model. The Spring Framework is [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software "Open-source software").

> The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platform.
> A key element of Spring is infrastructural support at the application level: Spring focuses on the "plumbing" of enterprise applications so that teams can focus on application-level business logic, without unnecessary ties to specific deployment environments.

小总结：

**Spring 是一个开源的应用程序框架。是 IOC （inversion of control）容器的一种实现。它为基于 Java 的现代企业应用程序提供了一个完整的编程和配置模型，并提供了一系列应用级别的基础设施支持。使得开发人员可以专注于业务逻辑的开发，从而提高开发效率。**

# History of Spring
*[Spring 官网：]([https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/overview.html#overview-history](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/overview.html#overview-history)

> Spring came into being in 2003 as a response to the complexity of the early [J2EE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform,_Enterprise_Edition) specifications. While some consider Java EE and Spring to be in competition, Spring is, in fact, complementary to Java EE. The Spring programming model does not embrace the Java EE platform specification; rather, it integrates with carefully selected individual specifications from the EE umbrella:
> *   Servlet API ([JSR 340](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=340))
> *   WebSocket API ([JSR 356](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=356))
> *   Concurrency Utilities ([JSR 236](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=236))
> *   JSON Binding API ([JSR 367](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=367))
> *   Bean Validation ([JSR 303](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=303))
> *   JPA ([JSR 338](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338))
> *   JMS ([JSR 914](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=914))
> *   as well as JTA/JCA setups for transaction coordination, if necessary.
>
> The Spring Framework also supports the Dependency Injection ([JSR 330](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=330)) and Common Annotations ([JSR 250](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=250)) specifications, which application developers may choose to use instead of the Spring-specific mechanisms provided by the Spring Framework.
>
> As of Spring Framework 5.0, Spring requires the Java EE 7 level (e.g. Servlet 3.1+, JPA 2.1+) as a minimum - while at the same time providing out-of-the-box integration with newer APIs at the Java EE 8 level (e.g. Servlet 4.0, JSON Binding API) when encountered at runtime. This keeps Spring fully compatible with e.g. Tomcat 8 and 9, WebSphere 9, and JBoss EAP 7.
>
> Over time, the role of Java EE in application development has evolved. In the early days of Java EE and Spring, applications were created to be deployed to an application server. Today, with the help of Spring Boot, applications are created in a devops- and cloud-friendly way, with the Servlet container embedded and trivial to change. As of Spring Framework 5, a WebFlux application does not even use the Servlet API directly and can run on servers (such as Netty) that are not Servlet containers.
>
> Spring continues to innovate and to evolve. Beyond the Spring Framework, there are other projects, such as Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data, Spring Cloud, Spring Batch, among others. It’s important to remember that each project has its own source code repository, issue tracker, and release cadence. See [spring.io/projects](https://spring.io/projects) for the complete list of Spring projects.

## Design Philosophy
*[Spring 官网：](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/overview.html#overview-philosophy)*

>When you learn about a framework, it’s important to know not only what it does but what principles it follows. Here are the guiding principles of the Spring Framework:
>
>* Provide choice at every level. Spring lets you defer design decisions as late as possible. For example, you can switch persistence providers through configuration without changing your code. The same is true for many other infrastructure concerns and integration with third-party APIs.
>
>* Accommodate diverse perspectives. Spring embraces flexibility and is not opinionated about how things should be done. It supports a wide range of application needs with different perspectives.
>
>* Maintain strong backward compatibility. Spring’s evolution has been carefully managed to force few breaking changes between versions. Spring supports a carefully chosen range of JDK versions and third-party libraries to facilitate maintenance of applications and libraries that depend on Spring.
>
>* Care about API design. The Spring team puts a lot of thought and time into making APIs that are intuitive >and that hold up across many versions and many years.
>
>* Set high standards for code quality. The Spring Framework puts a strong emphasis on meaningful, current, >and accurate javadoc. It is one of very few projects that can claim clean code structure with no circular dependencies between packages.
